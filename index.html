      	<ul>
      		<li>- You'll arrive at the <a href="#getting-here">College Building</a> and let reception know you're here.</li>
      		<li>- One of our research team will come down and meet you, and take you through some forms and information about the day.</li>
      		<li>- You'll be taken through to the lab to meet the researcher running your session. (Don't worry, they don't bite!)</li>
          <li>- The researcher will show you a website and ask you to carry out some tasks. It'll be just like when you take the tests at home, but more of a conversation instead of reading instructions from the screen.</li>
      	</ul>
      	<p>That's it! Once your session is over, you'll be given some information to take away, and your payment will be processed as usual.</p>
